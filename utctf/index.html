				<h2>What is a CTF?</h2>
				<p>A CTF, or "Capture the Flag" competition, is a type of computer security contest. Strings of text, referred to 
				as "flags," are hidden or encrypted in a series of challenges. During the competition, participants try to decrypt, 
				hack, reverse-engineer, or exploit the challenges in order to gain access to the flag. For each flag retrieved, the 
				team gets a certain number of points, and teams with the most points win.</p>

				<h2>How will UTCTF be run?</h2>
				<p>UTCTF will consist of several dozen problems that gradually increase in difficulty (and point value).
				The categories will include Binary Exploitation, Networking, Reverse Engineering, Cryptography, Web, and more.
				Some problems can be solved in a matter of minutes, while others may take hours.
				The source code and problem solutions will be released after the competition has ended.</p>

				<h2>Who can compete? Who can win prizes?</h2>
				<p>The top 3 teams will each win up to <b><u>$200</u></b> worth of prizes.
				Additionally, each winner of the writeup contest will win up to <b><u>$50</u></b> worth of
				prizes. The contest will be open to anyone around the world, but only teams that have an address
				<b><u>within the United States</u></b> will be eligible for prizes. There is no limit to
				team sizes, but we will only be shipping enough prizes for 4 people for each winning team
				($50 per team member). Team members do not need to be from the same location; however, 
				prizes will only be shipped to one location. </p>

				<h2>When?</h2>
				<p>6 PM CST on March 29th, to 6 PM CST on March 31st, 2024. 

				<h2>Where?</h2>
				<p>The competition will be completely free, and run entirely online - the only materials
				teams will need are a working computer with internet access and the ability to run
				desktop applications. Competitors should register online to form a team - registration
				will be opened soon, and can be done at any point before or during the contest. If you
				are a UT student feel free to come to our kickoff March 29th from 6 PM to 9 PM in GDC 2.216--food will be provided!</p>

				<h2>How will the writeup contest work?</h2>
				<p>Writeup submissions will be accepted during UTCTF, and up to 48 hours after the
				contest ends. Then, the ISSS officer team will judge the writeups. We will be giving out
				prizes for "Most well written", "Most technically interesting", and "Best unintended
				solution."</p>

				<h2>What is allowed?</h2> <ul>
				<li>Competitors can use search engines, Wikipedia, GitHub, books, etc. to try to solve the challenges. </li>
				<li>If they get stuck (or something is wrong with the challenge), competitors can ask the challenge authors for a hint, 
				but this hint will be shared publicly on the Discord in the interest of fairness. </li>
				<li>Competitors can ask other competitors for small hints. </li> </ul>

				<h2>What is not allowed?</h2> <ul>
				<li>Sharing of flags or explicit solutions is not allowed. </li>
				<li>Competitors are not allowed to directly attack UTCTF infrastructure or use tools that would overwhelm the infrastructure. 
				<b>This includes tools like dirbuster, ffuf, and other high-volume scanning/fuzzing tools.</b> </li>
				<li>Attacking or exploiting the server, other teams, or machines not explicitly
				designated as targets within the problems is against the rules. This includes both breaking 
				into such machines and denying others access to them (for example, by altering a key or ping-flooding). </li>
				<li><b>Engaging in any of these activities will result in your team being disqualified.</b></li></ul>

				<h2>Who is running UTCTF?</h2>
				<p>UTCTF is being run by students at The University of Texas at Austin within the <a href="https://isss.io">Information & Systems Security Society (ISSS).</a></p>
